# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Mouse Control using Python (OpenCV + Mediapipe + PyAutoGUI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project allows you to **control your computer mouse using hand gestures** captured via a webcam.  
The system detects your hand using **Mediapipe** and controls the mouse pointer using **PyAutoGUI**.  
- Move your **index finger** → Mouse pointer moves.  
- Bring **thumb and index finger close** → Mouse click action.  

This project is a part of my **Computer Vision subject**.
