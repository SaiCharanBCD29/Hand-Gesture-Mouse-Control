# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control
This project demonstrates a Computer Vision application where the mouse is controlled using hand gestures in real time. Built with Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI, it tracks hand landmarks via webcam to move the cursor and perform click actions without a physical mouse.
